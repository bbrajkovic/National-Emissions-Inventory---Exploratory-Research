## National Emissions Inventory - Exploratory Research

This repository contains R code to produce chart for analysis of [National Emissions Inventory](https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html) dataset.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI).
